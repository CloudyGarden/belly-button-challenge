# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to analyze the BellyButton Diversity Dataset. I used knowledge of json and html to build a static webpage, and used plotly to create the interactive dashboard. I used code gathered from class lecture and course material, inluding the class Xpert Learning Assistant.
